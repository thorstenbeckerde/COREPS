### The CORE Perceptual Storyteller Manifesto

#### From Thought Choreography to Experience Design

CORE began as an answer to a personal frustration: "a head full of thoughts, but empty hands". It was built for those who think in constellations, not straight linesâ€”a way to give form to the non-linear, layered, and emotional nature of cognition. It was, and still is, a system for thought choreography.
But as I started using it, a new potential emerged. The same framework used to map an internal thought process was also well suited to designing an external, interactive experience for players. So it went from mapping an idea to scripting a scene â€“ with one single, intuitive step.

**CORE Perceptual Storyteller (PS)** is the realization of that idea. It's a tool and a philosophy built on a single, poetic premise: **What if you could design the *feeling* of a story first, and let the plot emerge from it?**

#### The Guiding Principles
Traditional narrative design often starts with plot points, branching diagrams, and logic gates. CORE PS starts with perception. We believe:
1.	**Experience Precedes Plot.** The most memorable moments in stories are not just what happens, but how it *feels* to be there. You design the emotional and sensory arc of a scene first, thus providing a blueprint for the player's inner journey.
2.	**Structure Should Emerge, Not Be Enforced.** Outlines can be rigid, and mind maps can be chaotic. CORE PS uses a spatial, non-linear canvas that allows you to discover your story's natural rhythm and structure through the relationships between moments.
3.	**Emotion is a Mechanic.** In CORE PS, color isn't just decoration; itâ€™s a design tool. Tagging a scene as "Conflict" (ðŸ”´) or "Calm" (ðŸ”µ) is the first step in directing the art, music, and pacing. You are literally scripting the mood.
4.	**Perception is the Primary Interface.** The tool is structured around how a character (and thus, the player) perceives the world. Is this a raw sensory cue? An internal insight? A memory? By classifying chunks by their function, you are building your narrative from the inside out.

#### The Method: How Visual Grammar Becomes Game Grammar

CORE PS translates the core framework of the original system directly into game design mechanics. What was once metaphorical is now functional.

* **Chunks are Scenes.** A "chunk" is no longer just an idea; it's a self-contained moment in your game. Itâ€™s the container for the dialogue, the background art, the character sprites, and the music that define that beat of your story.

* **Shapes Define Scene Function.** The "semantic containers" of the original framework now define a scene's mechanical purpose.
	  * **Circle (â—¯):** An internal monologue or a moment of essential character insight.
	  * **Square (â–¢):** A foundational scene establishing lore, setting, or structure.
	  * **Triangle (â–³):** A moment of dramatic change, a plot twist, or a major event.
	  * **Parallelogram (â–±):** A standard, functional scene that moves the narrative forward.
	  * **Diamond (â—‡):** The crystallization of a key theme or a major player realization.

* **Links are Player Actions and Narrative Flow.** The relationships you draw are now the backbone of your game's script.
	   * A single, direct arrow becomes a **`jump`**â€”the story proceeds to the next scene.
	   * Multiple arrows originating from a "Decision Point" chunk automatically become a **`menu`** of player choices.
	   * The linkâ€™s label `triggers`, `reveals`, `echoes`) informs the nature of the transition, ensuring the connection is meaningful.
* **The Canvas is Your World.** The spatial map is your director's-eye view of the game. You can see the entire emotional flow at a glanceâ€”the descent into red-tagged conflict scenes, the rise into yellow-tagged discovery, and the quiet purple moments of introspection.

#### Who It's For

CORE PS is for perceptive emotional storytellers, as well as the reflective thinkers who inspired the original system. It is for:
* **Narrative Designers** who want to prototype the feel of a game before writing a single line of production code.
* **Visual Novelists & Indie Developers** who want an intuitive, visual front-end for engines like Ren'Py, bridging the gap between story concept and playable script.
* **Writers & Worldbuilders** who think in webs of interconnected moments and need a tool that honors that process.
* **Anyone** who believes that the heart of a story is not just a sequence of events, but a carefully composed symphony of perception and feeling.

CORE PS doesnâ€™t ask you to tame your ideas. It invites you to listen to them, map their emotional energy, and then seamlessly translate that map into an interactive experience. Itâ€™s not just note-taking; it's the beginning of a conversation between you, your story, and your future player.
